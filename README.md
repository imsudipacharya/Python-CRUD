This project Contains the basic CRUD operations in python where there is a list called my_posts , It contains the class name Post having the objects of tile, content, published, rating with different datatypes.   
  
I have defined two functions : one as a find_post through the id parameter and another as a find_index_post through the id obtaining the enumerate keywords for the obtaining an index list.  
  
In the main.py file there are various decorator like . @app.get, @app.post, @app.delete, @app.put with the different functions for the crud operation.  
  
  This repository will be helpful for those who are starting the python programing
  In this program I have used FastApi (NS & Go) and Pydantic which can define schema.   
  Overall I have also learn the basic programming in python and how to use various status code for various CRUD Functions.
